Answer2 <- "We have no data for the year 1993, as it was lost prior to compilation efforts beginning."

# Question 3: In how many incidents is there doubt as to whether the incident is terrorism? Code answer as numeric vector.####

# Question 6: How many incidents, per year, did we exclude because they did not have casualty data? What percentage have we been missing per year? Answer this question by creating a dataframe with year, number of incidents missing data in nkill or nwound,  number of incidents, and calculate the percent per year that are missing. #####

# Create a dataframe with year and count of missing data. HINT: You will have to add conditions to filter. 
missing_casualties_data <- gtd_df %>% filter(iyear >= 1970, crit1 == 1 & crit2 == 1 & crit3 == 1 & (nkill | nwoundte)) %>% group_by(iyear) %>% count() %>% rename(missing = n)

# Question7: What is the overall trend in the lethality of terrorist incidents? You need to answer this question with both a plot and a text description ####

# Create a data frame with year, number of incidents, number of casualties, number of victims killed, number of victims wounded, number of casualties / incident, number of victims killed /incident, number of victims wounded / incident.

# Question8: What is the relationship between amount of ransom terrorists demanded and the actual amount of ransom paid. Do incidents in all regions follow the same pattern (i.e., add region as color or facet wrap, which one works better?)? Answer this question using a scatterplot and a text vector description? HINT: You may need to make 2 scatter plots (1 that includes all data and one that filters out outliers) ####
# Base Scatterplot 
gtd_df %>% ggplot(aes(x=ransomamt, y=ransompaid))+geom_point()

# Color Approach 
# HINT: the format for scientific notation in R is 1e03 = 1000

  filter(ransompaid<1e08 & ransomamt < 2.5e08) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=ransomamt, y=ransompaid, color=region_txt))+

# Facet Wrap Approach 
gtd_df %>% filter(ransompaid<1e08 & ransomamt<2.5e08) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ransomamt, y=ransompaid)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~region_txt, scales = "free", nrow=4)
